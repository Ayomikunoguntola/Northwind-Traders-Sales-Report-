## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated 
---
 The major tool used to achieve this projecct is Power BI. I made use of various concepts like:
 - Power Query
 - Data Modelling
 - DAX (Data Analysis Expression)
 - Visualization Pane 
  
## Data Modelling 
---
In order to perform my analysis, I had to create a relationship between the tables. While Power BI automatically creates a relationship, I had to ensure that the Star Schema model was in use and in order to do that, I made sure that there was a central fact table which is the order table. To establish a star schema model, this fact table needed to be connected to the other dimension table using the primary key that uniquely identify each record and connect it to the fact table through a foreign key relationship
