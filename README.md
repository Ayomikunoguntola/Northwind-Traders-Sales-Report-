## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated 
---
 The major tool used to achieve this projecct is Power BI. I made use of various concepts like:
 - Power Query
 - Data Modelling
 - DAX (Data Analysis Expression)
 - Visualization Pane 
  
## Data Modelling 
---
In order to perform my analysis, I had to create a relatinship between thw tables. Whil Power BI automatically creates a relationship, I had to ensure that the Star Schema model wasin use and in order to do that, I need to make sure that there was a central fact table which is the order table and connect it to the various dimenension table using the primary key.
